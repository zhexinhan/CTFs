## Challenge
Your task is simple:
Find the first two primes above 1 million, whose separate digit sums are also prime.
As example take 23, which is a prime whose digit sum, 5, is also prime.
The solution is the concatination of the two numbers,
Example: If the first number is 1,234,567
and the second is 8,765,432,
your solution is 12345678765432
