# Cryptography

## Caesar Cipher
In cryptography, a Caesar Cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## Tricks
* Use the caesar_cipher.py script to get all 26 possible combination.
* Use the encoding_ascii.py script to convert a list of integers to ASCII characters.
* Use the encoding_url.py script to convert a list of URL code to characters.
